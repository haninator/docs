# Architecture

Our system is built on a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) to ensure scalability, maintainability, and
flexibility. <br />
By structuring the application into independent, modular services, we enable:

- **Scalability** – Services can be scaled independently.
- **Maintainability** – Updates and changes can be made without affecting the entire system.
- **Extensibility** – New features can be added with minimal architectural impact.

This approach ensures a future-proof and adaptable system while maintaining high reliability and performance.

## Architectural Component Overview

- **Architecture Style**: Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
- **Foundation**: Contains the Spring entities and the RabbitMQ Queues, Exchanges & Topics and serves as the foundation
  for extensibility
- **Services**:
    - **Engine** - Is the service for the learn sessions
    - **VillageMind** - Is the service for the village and the subjects
    - **MissionBoard** - Is the service for the quests
    - **Planner** - Is the service for the calendar
- **RabbitMQ**: For communication between the services

## File Structure

In the backend we decided to go for an uncomplicated monorepo. Therefore, every service got its own directory. We created
a root Gradle project to simplify the test and building process even more. Inside every service, we created directories
representing a specific feature.

In the frontend, we kept the old structure. For more information, please refer to the <Link href="https://gitlab.mi.hdm-stuttgart.de/pm086/learnmoto/-/wikis/02-Architecture">old documentation</Link>.

        |-providers                     --- (optional) for everything that comes from outside the app (API, DB, ...)
        |-feature_name_page.dart        --- The main widget that is used in the router

## Data Structure

We realized that the previous data structure was too nested, so we revised it.
This change resulted from transitioning from a document-based model to a relational one using PostgreSQL. <br />
The updated structure is designed to better align with Spring best practices, ensuring better scalability,
maintainability, and performance.

## Service Structure

We adhere to Spring’s standards to ensure consistency, maintainability, and scalability across the application.
This approach guarantees that all services are designed in line with best practices and follow a unified pattern.

### Foundation

The **Foundation** plays a crucial role in our architecture by providing essential building blocks for the services:

- **Defines interfaces** to ensure that all services follow the desired design pattern
- **Defines structure for controllers and services**, providing clear guidelines for implementation
- **Provides shared repositories**, enabling easy maintenance and reducing code duplication
    - **Supports expandability**, allowing for the easy addition of new features
      or services without significant changes to the existing codebase
    - **Enhances the developer experience (DX)** by offering a well-organized
      structure and predefined patterns that simplify development

### Services

Each service in the system is built using the Foundation's structures and guidelines,
ensuring consistency across the platform:

- **Uses the Foundation-provided interfaces**, ensuring uniformity and maintainability throughout the services
- **Implements tests** for all critical components, ensuring reliability and catching issues early in the development
  cycle
- **Follows Spring best practices**, ensuring that each service is scalable, maintainable, and easily integrated with
  the rest of the system

## App Implementation

Since the frontend app was originally integrated with the old backend (Firebase),
significant adjustments were needed to switch to our new Spring-based backend.
We had to modify the providers and related components to ensure compatibility with the new backend architecture.
This included updating data fetching and service interactions to work seamlessly with the Spring services.
As we are planning to replace the app next semester anyway, the primary goal during this phase was to ensure a functional
app, capable of retrieving and displaying data from the new backend while maintaining core functionality.

## User Authentication

Due to the large scope of this semester and the focus on the backend, we decided to keep the authentication
with Firebase for now. We receive a JWT token from Firebase, which is then included in API requests.
Upon receiving each request, the system verifies the validity of the token and handles authorization accordingly.
This ensures that only authenticated users can access protected resources while maintaining a smooth integration
with the Firebase authentication system.
