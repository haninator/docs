# Tests

For a seamless developer experience, testing is of great importance. Therefore, we aim to test every endpoint thoroughly.

### Integration test

Because of time restrictions we focused on integration tests, which creates a test system for every endpoint. Every test
is running by calling the Endpoint by url predicting the response. This insures us the service is running as expected.
Every service is tested with H2 as an in memory database. Because of some problems with mockito and RabbitMQ we skipped one endpoint,
which tries to use a cursed RabbitMQ mock.

> Most services are tested by one integration test from top to bottom, with some edge cases covered
