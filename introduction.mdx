# Introduction

As a team, we took the time to thoroughly evaluate the pros and cons of continuing with Firebase versus transitioning
to an in-house Spring backend. We discussed the features and benefits Firebase offers, such as its ease of use,
scalability, and built-in services. However, we also identified some limitations that Firebase imposes, especially
in terms of flexibility and data control.

On the other hand, moving to a custom Spring backend offers us greater control over our data, more flexibility
in handling complex use cases, and the ability to implement more tailored solutions that align with our specific
needs. Additionally, managing our own backend will provide us with the opportunity to
optimize and scale the system according to our requirements.

After weighing the advantages and trade-offs, we decided that transitioning to a Spring-based solution will
provide us with greater independence and a more customizable, sustainable architecture for the future.

## How to start

### Backend

The services can be found in the [monorepo repository](https://github.com/pomovillage/monorepo)

We provide a complete docker compose file, which contains all needed container and configuration via environment
variables.
</br>
Which means we suggest to use it because it's the simplest and straight forward experience. To build the dockerfiles,
the
.jars must be built first. Our setup is tested with java 17 and gradle 8.8, but for the root project we provide a gradle
wrapper.

To build the jars and run the docker compose run:

``` bash
./gradlew clean build -x test
docker compose up --build -d
```

If you want to run the services without using a docker image, you need a PostgreSQL database (tested with V17) and a
RabbitMQ (tested with V3). You might need to change the hosts in the `application.yml` configuration files.

### App

The app can be found in the [pomovillage-v.2 repository](https://github.com/pomovillage/pomovillage-v.2)

We developed the app for Android and tested it on Android 13 using a Pixel 6 Pro. For the Android emulator, we used JDK
19.0.2, and a Gradle wrapper is provided. Flutter has been tested with version 3.27.3.
For using the app, you don't need to start the backend locally. The app is using our server as a backend.

> If you experience any problems with that, please contact us!

For installation instructions, refer to the
official [Flutter installation guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).

To run the app, start the android emulator and then run from the `pomovillage_v2` directory:

```bash
cd pomovillage_v2/
flutter run
```

## Scope

At start of the project we wanted to define a scope for this project: For this project our target was to replace most of
Firebase functionality. We mostly aim for a backend which can be used in a similar way. To update a 'deprecated' app is
a necessary evil to represent the functionality of our new backend.

## Tools

### Organization tools

We are using a wide range of tools: Youtrack, GitHub and Miro.

### Techstack

As app technology we are sticking to flutter, for now. For the backend technology we decided to use Java with the well
known Spring Boot framework, because we have a lot of previous experience. To round this up we are using PostgreSQL,
RabbitMQ and Docker.
