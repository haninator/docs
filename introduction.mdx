# Introduction

As a team, we took the time to thoroughly evaluate the pros and cons of continuing with Firebase versus transitioning
to an in-house Spring backend. We discussed the features and benefits Firebase offers, such as its ease of use,
scalability, and built-in services. However, we also identified some limitations that Firebase imposes, especially
in terms of flexibility and data control.

On the other hand, moving to a custom Spring backend offers us greater control over our data, more flexibility
in handling complex use cases, and the ability to implement more tailored solutions that align with our specific
needs. Additionally, managing our own backend will provide us with the opportunity to
optimize and scale the system according to our requirements.

After weighing the advantages and trade-offs, we decided that transitioning to a Spring-based solution will
provide us with greater independence and a more customizable, sustainable architecture for the future.

## How to Start

### Backend

The services can be found in the <Link href="https://github.com/pomovillage/monorepo">monorepo repository</Link>.

We provide a complete Docker Compose file, which contains all needed containers and configuration via environment
variables.<br />
This means we suggest using it because it's the simplest and most straightforward experience. To build the Dockerfiles,
the `.jars` must be built first. Our setup is tested with Java 17 and Gradle 8.8, but for the root project, we provide a Gradle
wrapper.

To build the jars and run the Docker Compose, run:

```bash
./gradlew clean build -x test
docker compose up --build -d
```

If you want to run the services without using a Docker image, you need a PostgreSQL database (tested with V17) and RabbitMQ (tested with V3). You might need to change the hosts in the `application.yml` configuration files.

### App

The app can be found in the <Link href="https://github.com/pomovillage/pomovillage-v.2">pomovillage-v.2 repository</Link>.

We developed the app for Android and tested it on Android 13 using a Pixel 6 Pro. For the Android emulator, we used JDK
19.0.2, and a Gradle wrapper is provided. Flutter has been tested with version 3.27.3.
For using the app, you don't need to start the backend locally. The app is using our server as a backend.

> If you experience any problems with that, please contact us!

For installation instructions, refer to the
official <Link href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install">Flutter installation guide</Link>.

To run the app, start the Android emulator and then run from the `pomovillage_v2` directory:

```bash
cd pomovillage_v2/
flutter run
```

## Scope

At the start of the project, we wanted to define a scope for this project: Our target was to replace most of Firebaseâ€™s functionality. We mostly aim for a backend that can be used in a similar way. Updating a 'deprecated' app is a necessary evil to represent the functionality of our new backend.

## Tools

### Organization Tools

We are using a wide range of tools: YouTrack, GitHub, and Miro.

### Tech Stack

As app technology, we are sticking to Flutter, for now. For the backend technology, we decided to use Java with the well-known Spring Boot framework, because we have a lot of previous experience. To round this up, we are using PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, and Docker.
