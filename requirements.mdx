# Requirements

### Requirement Approach
We developed these requirements after discussing as a team the features Firebase offers and comparing them 
with the capabilities we need for our new backend. We identified the essential functions and qualities that 
Firebase provided and then determined the corresponding features we must implement in the new Spring backend
to replace Firebase while meeting our needs for scalability, control, and security.

### Business Requirements:
1. **Independence from Firebase** – The system must replace Firebase Firestore with 
a self-hosted backend to eliminate dependency on third-party cloud services
2. **Full Data Control** – The new backend must ensure full ownership and control over data storage, access, and management

### Non-Functional Requirements:
1. **Scalability** – The backend must be able to handle increasing data loads and user traffic efficiently
2. **Security & Compliance** – The system must ensure data protection through secure authentication and authorization
3. **High Availability & Reliability** – The backend should be designed to minimize downtime and ensure continuous availability
4. **Performance Efficiency** – The system should provide low-latency data access and efficient query performance

### Functional Requirements:
1. **Data Storage & Management** – The backend must support CRUD
(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for all relevant data entities
2. **API for Frontend Integration** – A RESTful API must be implemented to allow seamless communication with the mobile frontend
3. **Logging & Monitoring** – The backend must include logging and monitoring functionalities to track system health and errors
4. **User Authentication & Authorization** – The system must integrate with Firebase Authentication 
for user login and management while maintaining role-based access control in the new backend
