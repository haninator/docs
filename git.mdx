# Git

For our workflow we decided to use a feature based workflow. This fitted the most with our work styles and allows us to
work more efficient on parallel tasks

### Issue tracking

Because we are all using the Jetbrains IDE suite, we wanted to try Youtrack. The configuration for it is also found in
the [prod-server-stack-repository](https://github.com/pomovillage/prod-server-stack). We are using a Kanban style
board, to get an overview and to plan our next steps. 

If you want to get an inside on how we used it, feel free to ask on of us.
