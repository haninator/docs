# Pipeline

We decided to use GitHub Actions for our pipeline. Actions are tightly integrated into GitHub, therefore they seemed to
be the perfect choice.
> We are going to find out Actions do create a lot more problems, then they solve. More later on

## Jobs

We split our pipeline into seperated jobs, which fulfil their own purpose.

### SAST

We wanted to implement default SAST test, but as it turn out: To do it correctly we need GitHub Enterprise, which is
obviously to expensive for our small budget. Which means for now, no SAST.

### Tests

This job is running on every push and on every pull request. The only exception is on the push to master. The job is
running a simple `./gradlew test` command. We used the gradle wrapper to ensure that it works in the pipeline as well as
on a devs workstation.

### Build jar

The build job is triggered on every pull request. We use this to make sure we can package our application, therefor its
only needed before merging into a tracked branch

### Build Dockerfile

We tried to implement a job which builds the Dockerfile. This turns out to be a bit more tricky than useful. The
problem was the way we implemented the Foundation. Everywhere we used the Foundation classes we imported the compiled
jar. Which means the jar must already be available. Therefor it was tricky to create a dockerfile which also build the
jar. </br>
For now we resign ourselves to prebuild the jar and import them while building the dockerfile. That the Dockerfile or
the
Service jar compile successfully, the file structure needs to be exactly like it is in the project.

> TL;DR We skipped the build Dockerfile stage for now. First we need to fix the way the foundation is imported

## Changelog

We created a changelog for every release, even when we only released once :)

## 'prod' environment

To simplify the replacement inside the app we deployed our finished backend onto a server. Due to time problems shortly
before the medianight, we did not have time to create a dev proxy for a local development. Deploying made that
superfluous, and we didn't have to worry about port problems.</br>
The full docker compose can be found in a [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/pomovillage/prod-server-stack)

On the server we are running a traefik proxy, which routes the request by path prefix and forwards the request to the
correct port. This proxy also validates the JWT given in the authorization header, by using the 'experimental' JWT
middleware provided by the official plugin repository. The plugin validates the JWT by checking if it is expired. If
it is expired the proxy responses with an `401 unauthorized`. If it is valid, it forwards to the specific service.
